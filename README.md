# Social Magnet

Social networking sites such as Facebook have become ubiquitous platforms for communication. A social network is a means of keeping track of a set of people and the relationships between them. 

For this project, we were tasked to write a social networking application called Social Magnet. In Social Magnet, a member has a wall containing personal information as well as the last few messages to the wall. 

All members are automatically players of an integrated farming game called City Farmers. In the game, the player takes on the role as a farmer to manage a virtual farm by planting, growing and harvesting virtual crops.
